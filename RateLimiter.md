# RateLimiter

Rate Limiter Placement
A rate limiter controls the number of requests a client or user can make to a service within a given time frame. Its purpose is to protect against abuse, DDoS attacks, excessive resource consumption, and to enforce API usage policies.

#### Typical Placement:

##### At the API Gateway (Most Common and Recommended):

Where: The API Gateway itself. Many API Gateway solutions (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Kong, Apigee, Spring Cloud Gateway, NGINX with modules) have built-in rate limiting capabilities.
Purpose:
First line of defense: It's the ideal place to stop abusive traffic before it reaches your valuable backend microservices.
Centralized control: Allows you to define and enforce rate limits for all your APIs in one place.
Client-specific limits: Can apply limits based on API keys, IP addresses, user IDs (after authentication), or other request headers.
Policy enforcement: Crucial for monetization models (e.g., free tier vs. paid tier limits).
W.R.T. Load Balancer/Microservices: Sits after the external load balancer and before the microservices. The external load balancer directs traffic to the API Gateway, and the API Gateway then applies rate limits. If a request is throttled, the API Gateway returns a 429 Too Many Requests status code directly to the client.

##### Dedicated Rate Limiting Service:

Where: As a separate microservice that the API Gateway (or even individual microservices) calls to check limits.
Purpose: For extremely complex rate limiting requirements, high scale, or when you want a highly specialized, pluggable rate limiting engine. This service would typically use a fast distributed cache (like Redis) to store counters.
W.R.T. API Gateway/Microservices: The API Gateway would make an internal call to this dedicated rate limiting service for every incoming request (or a sample of requests) to check if it should be allowed.

##### Within Individual Microservices (Less Common for Global Limits, but useful for Service-Specific Limits):

Where: Inside the microservice code itself, often as a middleware or interceptor.
Purpose: To protect individual microservices from being overwhelmed by internal requests (e.g., from other microservices) or to enforce very specific, fine-grained rate limits that are unique to that service's domain.
W.R.T. API Gateway/Microservices: This is a secondary layer of defense or for internal enforcement. The API Gateway would handle the primary external rate limits, but a microservice might still implement its own rate limits if it has unique constraints (e.g., "this particular API can only be called 5 times per second by any other internal service").
