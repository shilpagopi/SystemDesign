##### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 
* an application layer protocol forming the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web
* a request–response protocol in the client–server model
* Request methods: Read-only : GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE

##### REST or Representational State Transfer 
* A single URI to access via various actions/HTTP verbs (GET/PUT/POST/PATCH/DELETE)
* It requires to write the requests for each type of entity in your database, in contrast to GraphQL.
* Not as space efficient as RPC.

##### RPC or the Remote Procedure Call 
* more space efficient than REST
* no special syntax like REST
* only used for internal communication (say remote login)

##### GraphQL 
* single request fetch all needed backend data and modify at front end
* more front-end development work, no backend dat aaggregations
